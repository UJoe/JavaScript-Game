A fun RPG engaging the player in the hardships of becoming a developer. If you answer questions about coding correctly, you'll get various weapons, protective equipment and other tools to help you in occasional battles. To make your character's development more realistic, you can improve your skills by practise, too. Carefully choose how you attack or how long you defend yourself against a certain enemy. Beware of Death coming for you more and more often as you advance! All enemies are getting stronger and stronger, but you can gain immortality, too! How? Find it out!

This game was created in a team, but about 80% of it by me. Music was downloaded from https://www.zapsplat.com/.
